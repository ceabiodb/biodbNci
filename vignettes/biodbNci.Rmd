# Purpose

biodbNci is a *biodb* extension package that implements a connector to
biodbNci, a library for connecting to the National Cancer Institute (USA)
CACTUS Database.

# Initialization

The first step in using *biodbNci*, is to create an instance of the biodb
class `Biodb` from the main *biodb* package. This is done by calling the
constructor of the class:
```{r, results='hide'}
mybiodb <- biodb::Biodb()
```
During this step the configuration is set up, the cache system is initialized
and extension packages are loaded.

We will see at the end of this vignette that the *biodb* instance needs to be
terminated with a call to the `terminate()` method.

# Creating a connector to CACTUS

In *biodb* the connection to a database is handled by a connector instance that
you can get from the factory.
biodbNci implements a connector to a remote database.
Here is the code to instantiate a connector:
```{r}
conn <- mybiodb$getFactory()$createConn('nci.cactus')
```

# Accessing entries

To get the number of entries stored inside the database, run:
```{r}
conn$getNbEntries()
```

To get some of the first entry IDs (accession numbers) from the database, run:
```{r}
ids <- conn$getEntryIds(2)
ids
```

To retrieve entries, use:
```{r}
entries <- conn$getEntry(ids)
entries
```

To convert a list of entries into a dataframe, run:
```{r}
x <- mybiodb$entriesToDataframe(entries)
x
```

# Chemical Identifier Resolver web service

Here is an example of calling the Chemical Identifier Resolver for converting a
SMILES into an InChI:
```{r}
conn$wsChemicalIdentifierResolver(structid='C=O', repr='InChI')
```

# Convert CAS IDs

There are currently two methods in NCI CACTUS for converting from CAS IDs to
InChI or InChI keys:
```{r}
conn$convCasToInchi('87605-72-9')
conn$convCasToInchikey('87605-72-9')
```

The conversion is made thanks to the Chemical Identifier Resolver web service.

# Closing biodb instance

When done with your *biodb* instance you have to terminate it, in order to
ensure release of resources (file handles, database connection, etc):
```{r}
mybiodb$terminate()
```
